# Build Issues Fixed ✅

## Issues Resolved

### 1. **Parallel Pages Conflict**
- **Problem**: Conflict between `/auth/callback/page.tsx` and `/auth/callback/route.ts`
- **Solution**: Removed the duplicate `page.tsx` file, keeping only the `route.ts` file
- **Result**: ✅ Fixed

### 2. **Missing Dependency**
- **Problem**: `@radix-ui/react-dropdown-menu` package not installed
- **Solution**: Installed the missing package with `npm install @radix-ui/react-dropdown-menu`
- **Result**: ✅ Fixed

### 3. **localStorage Server-Side Rendering Issue**
- **Problem**: Video generation page trying to access `localStorage` during SSR
- **Solution**: 
  - Updated to use authenticated user ID from auth context instead of localStorage
  - Added ProtectedRoute wrapper to the video generation page
  - Removed localStorage dependency entirely
- **Result**: ✅ Fixed

### 4. **Simplified User Menu**
- **Problem**: Complex dropdown menu component causing potential issues
- **Solution**: Created a simpler UserMenu component that shows user email and sign out button
- **Result**: ✅ Fixed

   - Sign in at `/signin`
   - Test protected routes

3. **Test video generation**:
   - Ensure user ID is properly scoped
   - Verify S3 operations work with authenticated user
